    <h2 class="gov-heading-l" id="how-title">How this tool chooses manifests</h2>

    <p class="gov-body">
        The MCC base release is the “anchor”. Once you pick it, the tool looks up matching manifest IDs for each campaign depot
        that lines up with that same release.
    </p>

    <ol class="gov-steps">
        <li class="gov-body"><strong>Pick a base release</strong> (the MCC build you want to downpatch to).</li>
        <li class="gov-body"><strong>Select content</strong> (which campaigns to download alongside MCC base).</li>
        <li class="gov-body"><strong>Choose a command style</strong> (Steam client console, DepotDownloader, or SteamCMD).</li>
        <li class="gov-body"><strong>Copy and run</strong> the generated commands.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="gov-body gov-muted">
        You will always get a command for <strong>MCC Base</strong>. Campaign depots are included only if a matching row exists.
